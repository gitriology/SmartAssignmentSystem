<b>Smart Assignment & Coding Evaluation Platform</b><br/>
MERN Stack • Role-Based Web App • Judge0 Execution Engine

A full-featured Assignment and Coding Evaluation Web Platform built using the MERN stack, designed for schools and colleges to streamline digital coursework, coding exercises, grading, and performance analytics. This project includes assignment creation, submission management, grading, student and teacher dashboards, coding problem management with Judge0 integration, and analytics.

Features

The platform allows teachers to create assignments with titles, descriptions, attachments, and deadlines, manage student submissions, grade work, and view analytics. Students can view assignments, upload files, and check feedback and marks. The coding module lets teachers create coding problems with starter code and test cases, while students can solve them using a built-in Monaco Editor. Test cases are evaluated only when the student submits their code, and results are stored along with pass/fail status. The system also includes authentication, protected routes, secure file uploads, auto deletion of submissions when an assignment is deleted, and a role-based dashboard for both teachers and students.
